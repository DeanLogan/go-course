# Go-Course Repository

Welcome to the Go-Course repository! This repository contains code developed while following the Go programming language course on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. You can find the course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo&amp;list=WL&amp;index=49&amp;t=161s).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **course**: This folder contains the code corresponding to each chapter in the explanatory section of the course.

2. **project**: Here you will find the code related to the project developed during the course.

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the code to enhance your understanding of Go programming.
