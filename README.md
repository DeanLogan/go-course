# Go-Course Repository

Welcome to the Go-Course repository! This repository contains code developed while following the Go programming language course on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. You can find the course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo&amp;list=WL&amp;index=49&amp;t=161s).

## Repository Structure

The repository is meticulously organized into two primary folders:

1. **course**: This section encompasses the code corresponding to each chapter within the instructional segment of the course.

2. **project**: Here, you'll discover the code associated with the hands-on project developed during the course.

Feel free to explore these folders and delve into the code, enhancing your understanding of Go programming.

## Course Description

The course is divided into different chapters within the [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo&amp;list=WL&amp;index=49&amp;t=161s). The concepts are explained within this video by the instructor, the code within the files for each chapter are a combination of the code created by the intstructor and some of my own notes. 

## Project Description

The project is a RSS feed aggregator. It's a web server that allows clients to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!
